## üîç Project Pipeline

### **Step 1: Data Analysis & Visualization**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis using statistical summaries and visualizations.
- Identified key patterns and correlations among health indicators such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and chest pain type.

---

### **Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values using **imputation techniques** to preserve data integrity.
- Addressed class imbalance in the target variable using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to improve model fairness.

---

### **Step 3: Model Development**
- Trained multiple classification models:
  - **Logistic Regression** ‚Äì for baseline interpretability
  - **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** ‚Äì for high precision and performance
- Compared models based on precision, recall, and F1 score.

---

### **Step 4: Model Evaluation**
- **SVC** achieved the best results with an **F1 score of 95%**, indicating strong predictive accuracy and minimal false positives.
- Created a model comparison report to justify SVC as the production-ready choice.

---

### **Step 5: Business Impact**
- Proposed how hospitals can integrate the model into their workflow to identify high-risk patients early.
- Suggested preventive strategies based on prediction outcomes to reduce long-term healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.

### ‚úÖ Final Thoughts
This project strengthened my understanding of end-to-end machine learning workflows‚Äîfrom data preprocessing and model selection to evaluation and stakeholder impact. It also demonstrated how AI can support real-world decision-making in healthcare.
